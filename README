FastJS is currently very experimental, the basic concept however is
to utilize Google's V8 JavaScript engine to serve up web pages over
the FastCGI interface.

Currently it's in a "mostly unusable" state as I've not spent the time 
to properly package libv8.a with the project, so I'm running it via the
compiled libv8.a inside of the ext/ directory (compiled against Linux 
2.6 on i586). There is one example script inside of the pages/ folder
which prints out some basic information and assembles a page (if you're
that curious as to what this currently looks like).

In addition to the basic JavaScript environment, FastJS preloads jQuery 
1.3.2 such that the $ function in the JavaScript context properly maps
to the jQuery root object.


In order to get this running, my lighttpd FastCGI configuration currently
looks something like this:

	$HTTP["host"] == "urlenco.de" {
		fastcgi.server = (
			".fjs" => ((
				"socket" => "/tmp/fcgi-fastjs",
				"bin-path" => "/home/tyler/source/github/fastjs/fastjs",
				"max-procs" => 1,
				"check-local" => "disable",
				"bin-environment" => (
				),
			)))}

	# snip
	
	index-file.names += (
		"index.html", "index.fjs"
	)
	static-file.exclude-extensions = ( ".fjs" )
